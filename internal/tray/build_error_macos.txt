❌ BUILD ERROR: macOS build without -tags nosystray

You are building on macOS without the required build tag.
This will cause AppDelegate symbol conflicts with Wails.

SOLUTION:
  Always use ONE of these commands on macOS:

  ✅ make build          (recommended - auto-detects platform)
  ✅ make dev            (for development with hot reload)
  ✅ wails build -skipbindings -tags nosystray
  ✅ wails dev -tags nosystray

  Or use the wrapper script:
  ✅ ./wails.dev.sh

DO NOT use plain `wails build` or `wails dev` on macOS!
